For the past 37 years, she has been a part of Echo, a local Christian vocal and instrumental group under the umbrella of EMFI, Inc., a nonprofit organization whose mission is to teach gifted youth about and encourage participation in music ministry/performance. Echo has been providing ministry and performing since 1981 which has included concerts in Branson at the Lawrence Welk Theater, Baldknobbers pre-show, and Starlight Theater, and placed 3rd out of 67 groups in a competition at the National Quartet Convention in Louisville, KY, in 2001. As a youth she participated in musicals, performing "behind the scenes" as part of the orchestra playing flute, but her main love musically is the piano.<p>Judy is an avid photographer and, because of that love, formed a business with her daughter. She brings those skills along with graphic design as one of the pieces of the puzzle and is privileged to be surrounded by many very talented individuals. As a mother of three grown children and five beautiful grandchildren, she has a deep appreciation for the need for outlets where talented youth can develop their gifts and share them with others. Her desire is to make a difference and inspire others to always put forth their very best and never settle for mediocrity when it comes to serving your fellow man, for that is what we are called to do. Love is the key.<!-- <h2 class="mdl-typography--headline">Recent Experience<ul class=mdl-list><li class="mdl-list__item mdl-list__item--two-line"><span class=mdl-list__item-primary-content><i class="material-icons mdl-list__item-icon">local_activity</i> <span>TITLE</span> <span class=mdl-list__item-sub-title>with SUBTITLE</span></span> <span class=mdl-list__item-secondary-content><span class=mdl-list__item-secondary-info>YEAR</span></span></ul>--></div></div></div></div></main><footer class=mdl-mini-footer><div class=mdl-mini-footer__left-section><div class=mdl-logo>Copyright CPCT</div></div><div class=mdl-mini-footer__right-section><ul class=mdl-mini-footer__link-list><li><a href=/about.html>About</a><li><a href=/contact.html>Contact</a></ul></div></footer></div>
