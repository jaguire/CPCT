                                        Joy is the board president and the founding member of Center Place Christian Theatre. Joy is a Speech-
                                        Language Pathologist, practicing at KC metro hospitals and rehabilitation programs. Her undergraduate
                                        degree was in Elementary Education and she enjoyed teaching 4 th grade at Center Place Restoration
                                        School for 11 years.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Joy became interested in theatre when her children were young. Her first onstage experience was as a
                                        villager, when her entire family appeared in Raytown Art Councilâ€™s 1999 production of Fiddler on the
                                        Roof. She also appeared onstage as Mrs. Squires, again with her entire family, in the Blue Springs
                                        Community Theatre production of The Music Man. Joy was a theatre mom for many years and learned
                                        from many wonderful directors in various community theatre organizations. While at CPRS, Joy &amp;
                                        others established the fall musical program, and directed the first 10 musicals there (<i>Annie</i>,
                                        <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>, <i>The Music Man</i>, <i>Sound of Music</i>, <i>The King &amp; I</i>,
                                        <i>Meet Me in St. Louis</i>, <i>Cinderella</i>, <i>Annie</i>, <i>The Little Mermaid</i>, and <i>Peter Pan</i>).

                                    <p>
                                        In 2008, requests came in from alumni of CPRS who graduated before the musical program began,
                                        asking if it were possible to have an alumni musical production in the summer. Center Place Christian
                                        Theatre was born! CPCT now involves many others from various groups of believers, in addition to CPRS
                                        alumni. Joy is so pleased to see CPCT continue to thrive and grow in unity of purpose, using God-given
                                        talents to serve the community. She is thankful for the wonderful people throughout the years who
                                        have worked tirelessly, volunteering their time to make CPCT what it is today!
