            <p>All participants sign a code of conduct contract delineating the clear expectation for them to reflect
                Jesus Christ in their countenance and their interactions, to bring "their best self" to every rehearsal
                and to represent the group with kindness, courtesy and positive values.

            <p>At open auditions, each performer sings a solo, and does a "cold read" which is scored by a casting
                committee. If needed, the performers are "called back" to assign the lead roles. At "call backs" the
                individuals are taught songs from the show, which they perform; and they perform scenes from the show,
                attempting to show characterization for the character for which they've been called back. A new round of
                evaluation by the casting committee is begun.</p>
            <p>Casting is a complicated puzzle, that is solved by matching the skill-set each person possesses with the
                needs &amp; requirements of a particular show; how the actors/actresses interact and look together; and
                the overall vision of the directors for the look and feel of the show.</p>

        <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col">
            <p>CPCT was established as a result of requests made from CPRS alumni to have their own summer musical program,
                since they graduated before CPRS started their Fall Musical Program.</p>
            <p>CPCT's name was chosen by CPRS alumni, honoring Center Place Restoration School as the origin of the group,
                but changed its original name (Center Place Alumni Theatre Group) to include those who did not attend CPRS.</p>
            <p>CPCT's name was chosen because we're located in the Center Place, and we desire to follow Jesus Christ,
                thanking Him for our talents and opportunities. We give Him all the honor and glory!</p>
            <p>CPCT has produced: Mary Poppins (August 2017), Little Women (Summer 2015), OKLAHOMA! (Summer 2012),
                 Fiddler on the Roof (Summer 2009), and 7 Brides for 7 Brothers (Summer 2008)</p>
            <p>CPCT has also produced a Musical Review (Spring 2018 &amp; 2016), a USO Style Show &amp; Dinner (Fall 2018),
                a Beloved Hymns Event (Spring 2017), and a Mystery Dinner Theater (Winter 2017).</p>
